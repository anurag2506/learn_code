'''
Basic arithmetic with broadcasting.
Create a tensor A of shape (3, 1) and a tensor B of shape (1, 4). 
Perform element-wise addition and element-wise multiplication on A and B. 
Explain how broadcasting allows this operation to be performed.

'''
Matrix multiplication and reduction.
Create a random tensor M1 of shape (5, 3) and another random tensor M2 of shape (3, 4).
Perform matrix multiplication using the @ operator.
Then, take the resulting matrix and compute the sum of all its elements.

Finding the maximum values and their indices.
Create a tensor with random integer values between 1 and 100, of shape (4, 6). 
Find the maximum value in the entire tensor. 
Then, find the maximum value and its corresponding index for each row.

'''
Element-wise exponential and square root.
Create a tensor x using torch.arange from 0 to 9. Compute the element-wise exponential of x (e^x). 
Then, compute the square root of the result.

Clamping and filtering tensor values.
Create a random tensor of shape (5, 5). Clamp all values in the tensor to be between 0.1 and 0.5.
