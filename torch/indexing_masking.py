'''
Advanced indexing and masking
Conditional filtering with Boolean masking.
Create a random tensor T with 20 elements. Find and print all elements in T that are greater than 0.5.
'''

'''
Using integer tensors for indexing (fancy indexing).
Create a random tensor data with shape (10, 10). Use a 1D tensor indices containing integers to select specific rows from data. Select rows at indices [0, 5, 9, 2].
'''

'''
Conditional element replacement with torch.where.
Create a random tensor x of shape (5, 5). Use torch.where to create a new tensor where all values in x greater than 0.5 are replaced with 1, and all other values are replaced with 0.
