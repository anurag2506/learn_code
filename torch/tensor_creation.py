'''
Create a tensor from NumPy and check its properties.
Create a NumPy array data with shape (4, 5) containing random integers between 0 and 10.
Convert this NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor. Print the tensor, its data type (dtype), and its device (device).
'''



'''
Generate a tensor with specific values and examine data types.
Use torch.arange to create a tensor with values from 5 to 15 (inclusive) with a step of 2. 
Use torch.full to create a tensor of shape (3, 3) filled with the value 3.14. 
Print both tensors and observe their default data types.
'''

'''
Explore log-spaced values and "like" creation.Generate 100 values logarithmically spaced between \(10^{0}\) and \(10^{3}\).
Create a new tensor with the same shape and data type as your log-spaced tensor, but filled with zeros.
